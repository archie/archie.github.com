And the winner is "Eigen":http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page! 

Yes, it wasn't even mentioned in the previous post. In fact I mixed the names of uBlas and Eigen up. Perhaps not a big surprise that C++ outperforms the others. More significant is that the library is single-threaded and yet compares faster than the parallel libraries jBlas and ParallelColt. The difference, however, is marginal: ~6900 ms vs ~7900 ms. 

The jumbo spot is, also not surprisingly, held by PHP. Memory explodes after 1M items for which it takes a rock-steady 220 seconds to compute <code>m*m.transpose()</code>.
