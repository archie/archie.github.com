According to my initial plan I want to start doing the evaluation in May. This means that a majority of the code will be frozen soon too. I'm almost on track with that plan, but there are some areas of the code which are still subject to change. 

Nevertheless, I've started to outline what I want to measure and tried to indicate its difficulty and usefullness. They are subject to change.
