Compiled a todo-list of things to implement / look at. No priorities assigned yet and everything is probably not relevant. 

 * Check architecture against original plan and update accordingly
 * Investigate distributed setup and testing with Akka
 * Remote actors identification and lookup - discovery of remote nodes
 * Change load-balancer to support remote actors
 * Dynamically redistribute itemsets if node is down or itemset is unavailable or overloaded -> this implies changing the index-mechanism too.
 * Fake lookups of preferences
 * Gossip health status of itemsets 
 * Load and register itemsets to actors and trigger reload 
 * Define bootstrapping procedure
 * Add proper configurability

And less code related
 * Define a preliminary title for the thesis
 * Draft an outline of the report to next supervisor meeting
