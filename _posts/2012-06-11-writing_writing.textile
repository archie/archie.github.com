title: Writing writing
--- 

Haven't provided much of info here in a while, so here comes a short update of what I've done: 

* writing, rewriting, trashing, and writing introduction again
* got first draft of report reviewed by my supervisor
* fixing comments from supervisor
* making some exploratory development to see the effect of parallelisation - not sure it will make it into the report
* taking measurements - specifically something called Mean Average Precision which I'm using to measure the accuracy of the recommendation results. I'll try to write a more detailed post on this soon. 
* procrastinating
* thinking that my report suck and mentally thrown it out of the window a few times
* found inspiration and solutions to problems when I least expected it
* writing and working from caf√©es around Barcelona. It is incredible how much more productive I am in these places. 4 hours with a good view of people passing by equals around 6-7h of office productivity. 

Now, back to writing. Here's the rest of my TODO: 

* rewrite abstract
* finish conclusion
* get the last MAP numbers into the report and explain them
* update two figures
* review the layout
* write acknowledgements

I can kind of see the finishing line somewhere over there. 

Rock on!
