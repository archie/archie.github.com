Facebook built Timeline by "recomputing tonnes of data":https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/building-timeline-scaling-up-to-hold-your-life-story/10150468255628920 into a common data format. Aggregators are used to query multiple databases simultaneously. Reminds me of Dremel which Google developed. 

Moving to Barcelona in less than a week. Excited.
