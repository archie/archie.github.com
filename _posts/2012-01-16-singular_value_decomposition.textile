While reading up on how singular value decomposition works I found this quote by "Simon Funk":http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html 

> "In today's foray, that model is called singular value decomposition, which is just a fancy way of saying what I've already eluded to above." 

Nice to hear other people shudder about how we try to over-complicate a lot of things, especially in research and marketing departments.

Anyway, the intuition behind SVD is that you have matrix and you want to find two matrices that, when composed together, yield the same original matrix with a minimal error of the approximation.
