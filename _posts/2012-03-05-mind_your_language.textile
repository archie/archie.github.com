In Erlang we often refer to processes as children, and shutting down a child is often called _kill children_. What a horrible thought! In Scala the processes are referred to as actors and we kill those too. Albeit slightly better than slaughtering unknowing youngsters. 

*nix is also a part of a dark conspiracy with _killall_ and its violent sibling _kill_.  

C, on the other hand, is a happy language. There data is set _free()_, which sounds like we're letting it of to a better place. I like that.

Where did language designers get their brutal metaphors from?
