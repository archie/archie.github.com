title: Supervisor meeting
--- 

This morning I headed up to UPC for another meeting with my academic supervisor. Updated him on the latest development which in short are: 

* major rewrite of the core functionality to improve fault-isolation and concurrency (and ended up with a lot cleaner codebase)
* primitives for load-balancing and replication in place
* performance measures indicate no measurable overhead with the latest developments - request handling is still primarily consumed by getting the top K items. 
* writing the system architecture in the report (still more to do here)

We agreed that by the end of next week I will send a first draft for him to review my writing and structure of the thesis in more detail.

The upcoming challenges that I'm currently aware of are (in no particular order): 

* testing using a multi-node setup (multiple JVMs)
* generate model based on an experimental offline algorithm implemented by Linas
* concretise the load-balancing and replication 
* write :) 

Work work!
